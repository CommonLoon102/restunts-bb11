# Opponent portraits

The six finalized opponent portraits are stored in
[`assets/opponents/game/`](../../assets/opponents/game/). Each **160 x 166**
indexed PNG is twice the original tile's width and height, with the exact
`SDMAIN.PVS:!pal` palette, a solid backdrop, and the original frame and numbered
label. The portraits were reconstructed as photographs with the built-in imagegen
tool from the corresponding original `SDOSEL.PVS` portraits, then reduced to the
game's palette. The original game resources remain unchanged.

| File | Opponent | Original shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `opp1.png` | Squealin' Bernie Rubber | `SDOSEL.PVS:opp1` |
| `opp2.png` | Herr Otto Partz | `SDOSEL.PVS:opp2` |
| `opp3.png` | Smokin' Joe Stallin | `SDOSEL.PVS:opp3` |
| `opp4.png` | Cherry Chassis | `SDOSEL.PVS:opp4` |
| `opp5.png` | Helen Wheels | `SDOSEL.PVS:opp5` |
| `opp6.png` | Skid Vicious | `SDOSEL.PVS:opp6` |

SDL3 builds display the enhanced photos only while SuperSight is enabled with
**F12**. F12 also switches the artwork while the opponent menu is open. If an
individual replacement cannot be loaded, that opponent keeps the original
portrait. Turning SuperSight off restores the original artwork for all six.
Clock and Ghost retain their original illustration.

The original portraits occupy 80 x 83 VGA pixels. The final tile's photo interior
is 148 x 158 at `(4,4)`. The loader crops this interior and displays it beneath
the original white border, numbered label and clipboard artwork. The game's
vertical VGA pixel correction gives the displayed portrait approximately 4:5
proportions; no display aspect correction is baked into the PNGs.

## Original reference extraction

With the original game files in `stunts/`, export lossless indexed references
and verify them with:

```sh
python3 tools/scripts/extract-opponent-portraits.py
python3 tools/scripts/extract-opponent-portraits.py --check
```

The standard-library extractor reuses the existing Stunts resource decoder and
writes to `out/opponents/original/`. It does not overwrite the enhanced photos.
The export manifest includes shape headers, original pixel hashes, and the
exact number masks used to verify preservation.

## Preparing the final portraits

Each base photograph was generated using only its matching original 74 x 79
photo crop as the visual reference, preserving its pose, expression, clothes
and accessories while resolving missing detail. The number was removed from
the reference and restored exactly afterward. The
[exact prompts and source paths](game2-generation-prompts.json) record all six
initial calls and subsequent full-resolution corrections. Original pixel
speckles and digitization noise are excluded from the restoration. Requested
corrections edit the retained full-resolution photographs before reduction.
Bernie's folded shirt collars are green. Otto has a gold monocle with a visible
single cord hanging vertically beside his cheek and curving over his shoulder,
an unzipped lightweight jacket over a black T-shirt, and closed puckered lips.
The user selected this shoulder-cord version as the final portrait.
No fallback CLI or API key was used.

Preparation follows the requested larger-to-smaller workflow:

1. Bilinear resize the reconstructed photograph into a 320 x 332 working tile,
   four times the original width and height, with a 296 x 316 photo interior.
2. Apply a gentle 3 x 3 median to the photo at that working size to remove isolated
   specks while retaining facial features and intentional clothing patterns.
3. Fill the connected flat backdrop with its exact original palette color.
   Closely matching enclosed backdrop regions, such as Otto's arm gap, are also
   filled. Masks follow the new photograph's silhouette.
4. Bilinear reduce the photo to half size, then map it to the exact game palette
   without dithering, added grain or sharpening.
5. Restore the original border and complete number rectangle as exact 2x copies.

The [final asset manifest](../../assets/opponents/game/manifest.json) records
source, working-image and final hashes, background colors, dimensions and
processing. The [preserved source gallery](game2-sources/README.md) links the six
selected full-resolution photographs and six 4x working tiles. The archive keeps
its historical `docs/opponents/game2-sources/` name; the runtime asset directory
is `assets/opponents/game/`.

With Pillow and original game data, rebuild or verify the final copies using:

```sh
python3 -m pip install Pillow
python3 tools/scripts/prepare-original-opponent-upscales.py
python3 tools/scripts/prepare-original-opponent-upscales.py --check
```

The script reads `docs/opponents/game2-sources/full-resolution/`, prepares the
4x RGB tiles in `docs/opponents/game2-sources/working-4x/`, and writes the final
indexed tiles to `assets/opponents/game/`. `--check` compares the regenerated
bytes without writing. The preserved source images match their selected
generated files byte for byte; their hashes and source paths are recorded
alongside them. Normal builds and the installed game need only the final six
indexed PNGs, without Pillow or imagegen access.

## Historical conversion tools and records

`prepare-opponent-portraits.py` is the earlier conversion tool for 296 x 316
full-bleed photo interiors. It bilinearly reduces a source to 296 x 316 and then
148 x 158, quantizes to the exact game palette without dithering, and expands
by nearest neighbor into 2 x 2 sample blocks. Those comparison assets and their
root-level masters are no longer included in `assets/opponents/`.
The finalized tiles use `prepare-original-opponent-upscales.py` instead.

For a separate experiment with the historical conversion, provide a source
directory containing six `oppN.png` photos and a separate output directory:

```sh
python3 tools/scripts/prepare-opponent-portraits.py \
    --source-directory docs/opponents/game2-sources/full-resolution \
    --output-directory out/opponents/legacy-photo-conversion
```

The earlier [generation prompts](generation-prompts.txt),
[Otto correction](otto-monocle-correction.txt),
[Joe correction](joe-sunglasses-correction.txt), and
[Skid regeneration](skid-original-regeneration.txt) describe the earlier master
set. The [current generation records](game2-generation-prompts.json) retain exact
historical prompts and generated source paths; their `preserved_*` fields link
only images retained in the selected source archive.

## Runtime paths

The loader first searches for `game/oppN.png`, then accepts a root-level
`oppN.png` as an optional compatibility fallback. Within each tier it checks
`opponents/` in the game data directory, beside the executable, then this
checkout's `assets/opponents/` directory. Missing, invalid or incorrectly sized
prepared files fall through to the next usable replacement; if none exists,
the original game portrait remains visible. F12 gates all replacements.

The prepared `game` tier accepts the final 160 x 166 tile format and the earlier
296 x 316 photo-interior format. For a final tile, the `(4,4,148,158)` interior is
expanded by nearest neighbor into the 296 x 316 enhanced photo area, preserving
every palette color. Legacy 296 x 316 files are used without resizing. The menu
continues to draw its original number, border and clipboard over the photograph.

CMake runtime installation copies only the final six prepared PNGs to
`bin/opponents/game/`. The archived photographs and working tiles are for future
edits and regeneration. No extra original game resource files are required.
