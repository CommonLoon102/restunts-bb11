# Play Restunts on stock TempleOS

This package targets stock TempleOS 5.03 from the official `TempleOS.ISO`.
Start with an existing, working installation of the original TempleOS.
The distributable package contains the native HolyC port, documentation, and
installation/import tools. **It contains no original game data.** Each player
must supply their own Broderbund Stunts 1.1 files (the 12 February 1991 release).
No fork, SDL, network connection, shared folder, or additional compiler is needed
inside TempleOS. TempleOS compiles the HolyC sources when you launch it.

The game renders 3D geometry at 640×400 with 16 colors and uses the PC speaker.
Projection and rasterization use the higher resolution to add detail. The original
8:5 aspect ratio is preserved, with the image centered on the 640×480 display
between 40-pixel black bars. Original bitmap artwork and UI use a uniform 2× scale
and retain their source detail. Keyboard and mouse input are supported.

## What to download

Unzip **RESTUNTS_STOCK_TEMPLEOS.ZIP on the host computer**. It contains:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `RESTUNTS.ISO` | Code-only installation CD in TempleOS's native RedSea format. |
| `README.MD` | This guide, readable on the host. |
| `SHA256SUMS.TXT` | SHA256 checksums for the package files. |
| `CONTENTS.TXT` | SHA256 checksums of the individual files inside the CD. |
| `BUILD.TXT` | Build-system ISO fingerprint and package details. |
| `DATA_CD_TOOL/` | Host Python tool and HolyC importer for your own game data. |

Use the ISO directly as a virtual CD. It is a **data CD**, not a bootable copy of
TempleOS. Keep booting your existing TempleOS hard disk. The ZIP does not need
to be opened inside TempleOS.

The instructions below use `T:` for the CD drive and `C:` for the writable
TempleOS installation. `DrvRep;` lists the drives. Use your actual letters if
they differ. A VM with 1 GiB RAM and two virtual CPUs is the tested configuration;
allow at least 32 MiB of free space for installation and room for your saves.

## 1. Put the game CD in the VM

For VirtualBox:

1. Shut down the TempleOS VM.
2. Open its **Settings → Storage**.
3. Select the existing CD/DVD drive on the IDE controller, click the disc icon,
   choose **Choose a disk file**, and select `RESTUNTS.ISO`.
4. Keep the installed TempleOS hard disk attached. In **System → Boot Order**,
   put **Hard Disk** before **Optical**.
5. Start the VM normally from its hard disk.

For QEMU, use the same working VM and hard disk as before, replacing its CD image
with `RESTUNTS.ISO`. With a conventional IDE CD drive, the relevant options are:

```sh
-cdrom /path/to/RESTUNTS.ISO -boot c
```

These are options to add to your existing QEMU command, not a complete command
that creates or replaces your OS disk. The image can also be burned as a disc
image for an already working TempleOS computer with a supported optical drive.

## 2. Open the CD inside TempleOS

Use a TempleOS terminal task. Type these commands, pressing Enter after each:

```c
DskChg('T');
Cd("T:/");
Dir;
```

The directory should contain `INSTALL.HC`, `PLAY.HC`, `VERIFY.HH`, `PORT`,
an empty `DATA` directory, and `README.MD`. `DskChg` refreshes removable media after a CD change.

If `T:` is not listed by `DrvRep;`, mount the optical drive first:

1. Run `Mount;`.
2. Press `T` at **Drive Letter** (this prompt takes a single key).
3. At **I/O Port Base0**, type the probe-list number for the CD/DVD device
   (for example, the entry identifying a QEMU or VirtualBox CD-ROM), then press Enter.
4. Press Enter at the next **Drive Letter** prompt to finish.
5. Run the three CD commands above.

Selecting the numbered probe entry supplies the controller ports and device unit
automatically. This is mounting an existing CD; partitioning and formatting are
not part of installing this game.

## 3. Install to the hard disk

While still in `T:/`, run:

```c
#include "INSTALL.HC";
```

The installer copies the CD contents to **`C:/Restunts`**, then compares every
copied file with its source. Wait for the installation-success message before
continuing. The sources are under `C:/Restunts/PORT`; `C:/Restunts/DATA` is
initially empty. Import your own game files in the next step.

The installer refuses to overwrite an existing destination, including a previous
installation or an incomplete copy. To choose another empty destination after
loading `INSTALL.HC`, run, for example:

```c
RestuntsInstall("C:/Restunts2");
```

Use the same destination in the launch commands below. Keep the game on a
writable hard disk: running the data directly from the CD would prevent saves.

## 4. Create a private CD from your own game files

Do this on the **host computer**, outside TempleOS. You need Python 3 and your
own extracted Stunts 1.1 directory. If the game is in an archive, extract it first.
Choose the directory containing `MISC.RES` or `MISC.PRE`, the car/shape resources,
and tracks. The tool copies supported game resources and uppercases their names;
it does not rename or modify the originals.

Open a host terminal in the extracted `RESTUNTS_STOCK_TEMPLEOS` package folder.
On Linux or macOS:

```sh
python3 DATA_CD_TOOL/MAKE_DATA_CD.PY \
    --data "/path/to/STUNTS11" \
    --output "../STUNTSDATA.ISO"
```

On Windows with Python installed:

```bat
py -3 DATA_CD_TOOL\MAKE_DATA_CD.PY --data "C:\Games\STUNTS11" --output "..\STUNTSDATA.ISO"
```

Replace the example game path with your own directory. Keep the files in
`DATA_CD_TOOL` together; the Python script uses the adjacent HolyC import helpers.
No QEMU, mounting software, or third-party Python library is needed to create
this private CD. The output path must not already exist.

`STUNTSDATA.ISO` contains **your game data**. Keep it for personal use, outside the
redistributable package; do not include it when sharing the port. Only the code-only
`RESTUNTS_STOCK_TEMPLEOS.ZIP` is the distribution package.

## 5. Import the private data CD into TempleOS

Replace the VM's `RESTUNTS.ISO` disc with your newly created `STUNTSDATA.ISO`.
In VirtualBox, use **Devices → Optical Drives → Choose a disk file**, or shut
down and change the optical image in Settings as in step 1. Keep booting the
installed TempleOS hard disk.

At a TempleOS terminal, enter these commands separately:

```c
DskChg('T');
Cd("T:/");
#include "IMPORT.HC";
```

The importer requires the port to be installed first. It copies the resources
into `C:/Restunts/DATA` and verifies every copied file against the private CD.
It refuses to import over a nonempty `DATA` directory, protecting existing saves.
Wait for the import-success message.

For a non-default installation directory, load `IMPORT.HC` as above, then call:

```c
RestuntsImport("C:/Restunts2");
```

If you already have a nonempty data directory, keep it and its saves. To make a
separate fresh installation, install the code CD into a new directory before
importing. A failed partial import is reported; inspect that directory before
retrying into another fresh installation.

The private CD is only for transfer. After import, the game reads and writes the
hard-disk copy, so you can eject it.

## 6. Launch and play

Open a **fresh terminal task** for each launch. A normal TempleOS terminal can
open another task with Ctrl+Alt+T. Then run:

```c
Cd("C:/Restunts");
#include "PLAY.HC";
```

Compilation can take a minute or more under software emulation. HolyC may print
warnings about 64-bit register variables; these are expected because the port
explicitly preserves DOS integer widths. Wait for the intro or main menu.

On the main menu, use Left/Right to select **Let's Drive**, then press Enter.
With the standard default configuration, driving uses the keyboard and automatic
gears. An imported configuration may differ; choose keyboard control and automatic
transmission in the game if needed.

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Up | Accelerate. |
| Down | Brake. |
| Left / Right | Steer. |
| F1 / F2 / F3 | Change camera. |
| P | Pause. |
| Escape while driving | Open the replay viewer. |
| Ctrl+Q | Open the original **Exit to Dos** dialog; choose **Yes** to return to TempleOS. |

The exit dialog retains its original DOS wording. Escape at the main menu
returns to the intro; use Ctrl+Q to quit the game.

For a launch without the intro, use a fresh task and these commands instead:

```c
Cd("C:/Restunts/PORT");
#include "LOAD.HC";
Restunts("C:/Restunts/DATA", TRUE);
```

Install and import once. On later boots, repeat only the launch commands.
Both CDs may be ejected after import. Tracks, replays, high scores, and
configuration files remain in the installed `DATA` directory.

## PC-speaker audio in a VM

For QEMU on a Linux host using PulseAudio (or its PipeWire compatibility server),
add these options to the existing VM command:

```sh
-audiodev pa,id=speaker -machine pcspk-audiodev=speaker
```

Use `qemu-system-x86_64 -audiodev help` to see the backends included in your QEMU
build. Other hosts can choose their native backend, such as `coreaudio` on macOS
or `dsound` on Windows. See the [QEMU PC-speaker documentation](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/i386/pc.html).

VirtualBox's PC-speaker passthrough is Linux-only and supports beeps, not PCM
samples. Its ordinary sound-card setting does not enable this output. See the
[VirtualBox PC-speaker limitations](https://docs.oracle.com/en/virtualization/virtualbox/7.2/user/reference.html).
The game can still be played without sound; QEMU provides the tested speaker
emulation path.

## If something does not work

- **CD shows the old files:** use `DskChg('T');` again after changing the optical
  image, then `Cd("T:/");` and `Dir;`.
- **File system not supported:** use the supplied native RedSea `RESTUNTS.ISO`.
  A generic ISO9660/Joliet image made from the extracted files is unsuitable for
  the stock system's normal directory-copy commands.
- **Original game data is missing:** complete steps 4–5 using your own Stunts 1.1
  files. The code CD deliberately contains no game assets.
- **Missing include file:** start with the exact `Cd` command above, preserve
  filename case, and keep `PORT/generated` intact. Extensions must stay uppercase.
- **Installer reports a copy mismatch:** check free space and the CD attachment.
  It leaves the partial destination for inspection; use a new empty destination
  for the next attempt. Do not replace an existing installation's save files.
- **No sound in the VM:** enable the hypervisor's PC-speaker emulation. An SB16,
  AC97, or HDA sound device by itself is not the game's audio output. QEMU can
  connect the PC speaker to a host audio backend using `pcspk-audiodev`.
- **Keyboard goes to the host:** focus/capture the VM first. Normal driving uses
  arrow keys, not WASD.

## Building the package again

This section is for maintainers on the host; a player only needs the ZIP above.
The builder requires Python 3, QEMU, `mkfs.fat` from dosfstools, and `mcopy` from
mtools. It boots the supplied official TempleOS ISO in a disposable guest and
uses the stock `RedSeaISO` writer. It never attaches an existing VM disk.

From the repository root:

```sh
python3 src/restunts/platform/templeos/tools/PACKAGE.PY \
    --iso /path/to/TempleOS.ISO \
    --output /path/to/new/RESTUNTS_STOCK_TEMPLEOS
```

The output path must not exist. This creates the package directory and a sibling
`RESTUNTS_STOCK_TEMPLEOS.ZIP`. Original input files are not renamed or changed.
The public builder has no game-data input. Its CD has an empty `DATA` directory,
and the ZIP includes the standalone private-data CD tool. The public build does
not read or package anyone's game assets.
