# Renderer parity with the original game

Pixel comparisons use the unchanged Borland oracle in `tools/oracles/borland`.
Rendering and simulation are not independent in the original executable: its
physics reads values left in stack slots by earlier rendering calls. The C port
represents those values explicitly instead of depending on undefined C locals,
adjacent allocations, or the host compiler's stack layout.

## Sphere bounds

In `asmorig/seg006.asm`, `loc_25C92` first submits `(x - radius, y - radius)`
to `rect_adjust_from_point`. For its second point it assigns `x + radius` to X,
then overwrites that same X with `y + radius`, leaving Y unchanged. The C sphere
path previously used a conventional bounding square. Crash explosions scale
from this rectangle, so their placement and size differed even with identical
simulation state and source pixels. `shape3d_adjust_sphere_bounds` reproduces
these writes; wheel bounds retain their distinct original calculation.

## Renderer values consumed by physics

The original `get_a_poly_info` calls leave saved frame pointers, far return
addresses, rasterizer locals, and arguments in the stopped player's wheel-heading
slots. Its polygon-data pointer and pattern temporary overlap the opponent's
heading slots. The preceding skybox writes some of those slots too, including
on branches that clip away the whole sky rectangle. A slot retains its earlier
value on branches that do not write it.

`shape3d_set_legacy_render_stack` binds those logical slots to the existing
`legacy_execution_residue` buffers during sampled replay rendering. Rasterizer
and skybox paths retain the values written by their corresponding original
instructions. The existing stopped-wheel physics then consumes these buffers.
This restores the original simulation after stops and crashes as well as the
immediately rendered image.

A separate reused stack word holds the SI register saved by `update_grip`.
After a capped collision scan, physics can consume it as the fourth wheel's
contact distance. It is not always 80: the sampled dump loop supplies its output
handle, the single-image loop supplies its original argv offset, and checkpoint
and race-start paths overwrite it with their own index or distance. Explicit
caller parameters carry these values through the C simulation.

## Caller and address calculation

`pixldump/legacy_context.c` describes the archived executable's ABI, not a
particular replay. It derives the load segment from the DOS PSP and calculates
original stack placement from the executable path and decoded argument lengths.
The polygon buffer's logical segment follows the original allocation order,
using the sizes of the loaded resources. Thus replay names, optional extensions,
DOS directories, and environment placement do not require special cases.

The original assembly and archived executable remain unchanged. Ordinary C
game callers keep their existing default simulation contract; the pixel-dump
wrapper selects its own original caller context. BMP mode simulates without
intermediate rendering, while hash mode renders frame 0 and every fifth frame.
Those modes can therefore reach different states in the original game itself.

## Regression checks

Run `bash src/restunts/tests/run-host-tests.sh` for the host tests. Coverage
includes sphere versus wheel bounds, rasterizer primitive types, retained values
on skipped branches, skybox clipping, player and opponent stopped-wheel motion,
caller-register suspension effects, and DOS argv/address calculations.

Use `tools/scripts/pixelcheck.sh REPLAY.rpl false 2 0` for a complete sampled
comparison with existing executables, or append a frame for a BMP comparison.
Both sides must use the same camera, target, arguments and DOS environment.
A match requires complete output through the replay's last sampled frame; equal
partial files are not evidence of renderer parity.
