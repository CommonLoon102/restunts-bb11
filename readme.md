## Running the game

An SDL3 [WebAssembly build](docs/wasm.md) runs directly from a local HTML file
without a web server. Only enhanced artwork is embedded; select your own
original game folder in the browser before starting.

All builds require the original Broderbund Stunts 1.1 game data (12 Feb. 1991).
Startup checks the `gver` text in `MISC.RES`, or `MISC.PRE` when no unpacked
resource exists, and reports an error if it is missing, invalid, or different.
Other resources are not compared, so custom cars, graphics, opponents, tracks,
and horizons remain supported.

Run `restunts.exe` in DOSBox or DOSBox-X with `core=dynamic`, `cycles=max`, and `aspect=true`.
Mount `stunts/` directly as a DOS drive in the emulator.

For DOSBox-X, use these recommended settings in the `[dos]` section of your
configuration file:

```ini
[dos]
# DOS version (DOSBox-X only)
ver=7.1

# Put the shell into upper memory (DOSBox-X only)
shellhigh=true

# Enable long file name support (DOSBox-X only)
lfn=true

# Disable DOSBox-X's low-memory padding to free conventional memory.
# Original dump tools need this space when loading large custom dashboards.
minimum mcb free=1
```

### F3 camera views

Press **F3** to select the original adjustable camera. Press F3 again to cycle
through three chase views, then back to the original view:

1. Original F3 view, with its existing angle, zoom, and dashboard visibility.
2. Three right steps and two down steps from the default angle, with two zoom-in steps.
3. The same chase angle at the default zoom.
4. The same chase angle with three zoom-out steps from the default zoom.

The three chase presets hide the dashboard. Cycling back to the original view
or selecting another camera restores the original F3 position and prior dashboard
visibility. Returning to F3 from another camera starts with the original view.
Replay pan and zoom controls still work; the next F3 preset uses its fixed position.

### HyperVision and FPS display

Press **F12** while driving or viewing a replay to toggle HyperVision. In SDL3
builds (Windows, Linux, BSD, macOS, 32-bit DOS, and WebAssembly), it starts with
the entire 30 x 30 track, detailed models, and 1280x800 internal rendering. Driving and replay rendering
adapt to sustained CPU load to target 60 FPS, using these stages in order:

| Stage | Visible area and geometry | Internal rendering |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Full track, full geometry | 1280x800 |
| 1 | Large camera mask below | 1280x800 |
| 2 | Large camera mask | 640x400 |
| 3 | Large camera mask | 320x200 |
| 4 | Small camera mask below; minimum quality | 320x200 |

The masks below face north. `C` is the active camera tile, `H` selects full
geometry, `L` selects available low geometry, and `.` excludes the tile. A
missing low model falls back to its full model. Both masks follow the active
camera and rotate with its viewing direction, including diagonal headings.

```text
Large mask    Small mask
..LLLLL..     LLLLL
.LLLLLLL.     LLLLL
.LLLLLLL.     LHHHL
LLHHHHHLL     HHHHH
LLHHHHHLL     .HCH.
LLHHHHHLL
LLHHHHHLL
.LLHHHLL.
..LHHHL..
...HCH...
```

Pressing **F12** toggles **Auto** and **Off**. Pressing it while a locked preset
is active turns HyperVision off; the next F12 selects Auto. **Shift+F12** enables
HyperVision with **Full**, then cycles through these locked presets:

| Preset | Stage | View | Internal resolution |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Full | 0 | Full HyperVision | 1280x800 |
| High | 1 | Large mask | 1280x800 |
| Medium | 2 | Large mask | 640x400 |
| Low | 3 | Large mask | 320x200 |

Shift+F12 after Low returns to Full. From Off or Auto, Shift+F12 starts at
Full. Locked presets remain selected across race/replay resets and do not
automatically reduce or restore quality. The small-mask stage is available only
in Auto. Each F12 or Shift+F12 press displays `HyperVision: <name>` for two seconds
below the FPS and render-time lines, even when F11 is disabled.

To start with a locked preset, pass exactly one of `--hv:full`, `--hv:high`,
`--hv:medium`, or `--hv:low` to the executable. For example:

```sh
./restunts --hv:medium
```

The preset is active from the intro onward. These options are case-insensitive.
Multiple preset options, including duplicates, and unknown presets report an
error and exit. Without a preset option, HyperVision starts off as usual. F12 and
Shift+F12 can change the selection later. The options apply to SDL3 builds,
including 32-bit DOS.

An entire multi-tile object stays visible if any of its tiles is inside the
mask. Any `H` overlap keeps full geometry; otherwise an `L` overlap uses low
geometry when available. The same policy applies to rendered cars: their occupied
tiles determine visibility and geometry. `C` always keeps full geometry. The
graphics menu's scenery setting still applies.

A sustained overload reduces one stage after about half a second at the target
frame rate; isolated stalls do not trigger a reduction. About three seconds of
frames with spare processing time restore one stage. Failed recovery attempts
increase the wait before trying again. The small mask at 320x200 is the floor;
there are no further reductions if the machine still cannot reach 60 FPS.

Resolution changes affect the internal renderer. The output keeps its existing
4:3 presentation, window/fullscreen size, and DOS VESA display mode. At 320x200,
HyperVision disables car shadows and uses the original horizon artwork. This
applies to locked Low and both of Auto's lowest stages; higher resolutions restore
shadows and enhanced horizons. Physics and replay data are unaffected. Switching HyperVision
off restores the original draw distance, detail policy, and rendering limits;
enabling it starts at full quality.

HyperVision replaces the SDL3 SuperSight rasterizer with visibility spans resolved
from polygon depth, without painter-style sorting. Its target is a 2 GHz Core 2 Duo;
small visual differences are acceptable to reduce CPU cost. Classic rendering and
replay compatibility remain separate requirements. See the
[HyperVision architecture and measurement notes](docs/hypervision.md).
The earlier enhancement was inspired by Alberto Marnetto's
[SuperSight](https://marnetto.net/2025/02/20/broderbund-stunts-1).

The Open Watcom 16-bit DOS build retains its 110-tile SuperSight mode, with
up to 592 primitives in a 13 KiB rendering buffer and reduced distant detail
or visibility when crowded scenes exceed that capacity. F12 toggles it on and off
and displays `SuperSight: On` or `SuperSight: Off` for two seconds, even when the
FPS counter is hidden. This build has no SuperSight presets.

In SDL3 builds, HyperVision starts 3D rendering at **1280x800**, four times the
original width and height. Player and opponent
car-selection previews use the same higher resolution; F12 also works in those
screens and in the track preview. Dashboard artwork, replay controls, and the
surrounding menu UI retain their original pixel detail and size. HyperVision clips
custom dashboards and the 3D view above visible replay controls so they remain
unobstructed. Switching HyperVision off restores 320x200 rendering and the original
dashboard layout.

In SDL3 builds, HyperVision corrects each car model's visible ride height so
its underside meets the driving surface, including cars with spherical wheels.
This presentation offset follows the car's rotation and preserves suspension
movement and jumps without changing physics or replay data. The original renderer retains the original car positioning.

HyperVision uses fewer segments for wheels and spheres that occupy only a small
part of the screen. Segment counts follow their projected size; nearby round
shapes and background geometry retain their full detail.

In SDL3 builds, HyperVision adds car-shaped shadows on nearby surfaces below
each car. Small cached silhouettes follow the model's size, body, wheels, and
suspension. Light comes from the south at about 70 degrees above the horizon,
with a short northward extension and soft edges. Shadows shrink as the car
rises above the surface. Opaque roads and ramps block shadows from reaching
surfaces below them. Grille surfaces receive half-strength shadows and pass half
the shadow strength to the next surface; successive grilles halve it again.
Cars do not receive shadows, ghosts do not cast them, and the viewed car's own
shadow is hidden in the F1 cockpit camera. The player
and opponent car-selection showrooms use the same shadows beneath their rotating
car previews while HyperVision is on at 640x400 or 1280x800.

HyperVision also uses [AI-refined skybox artwork](docs/skyboxes/README.md), with
each horizon image at four times its original width and height, at 640x400 and
1280x800. The 320x200 mode and classic rendering use the original skybox artwork.
Banked and upside-down views remain supported at every HyperVision resolution.
Missing enhanced PNGs fall back to the original strips. The Open Watcom 16-bit DOS
version retains its existing renderer.

The opponent-selection and opponent car-selection screens also use
[enhanced portraits](docs/opponents/README.md) while HyperVision is on. The final set
in `assets/opponents/game/` contains
160 x 166 tiles, twice the original width and height, with the exact game palette
and solid backgrounds. F12 switches portraits in both menus; missing or unreadable
replacements fall back individually to the originals. Original numbered labels
and the clipboard frame are preserved. The selected full-resolution sources and
4x working tiles are archived in `docs/opponents/game-sources/` for regeneration.

HyperVision also targets **60 FPS** in SDL3 driving, replay playback, the nighttime
intro, and rotating car previews. Driving and replay playback interpolate between
completed physics states. At the normal 20 Hz simulation rate, each new keyframe
first displays a one-third blend toward it from the previous keyframe, then a
two-thirds blend about 16.7 milliseconds later, then the complete new keyframe
after about 33.3 milliseconds. This keeps visual motion about 33.3 milliseconds
behind the physics timeline at each presentation, before rendering and display
delays, and avoids corrections between predicted motion and the next real update.
Car position, rotation, suspension, and follow cameras use the same interpolation
fraction. Recorded ghosts are sampled at that same visual time even when their
replay uses a different physics frame rate.

Input sampling, recording, and authoritative physics retain their original 10 or
20 Hz schedule. A 10 Hz simulation uses six visual samples per keyframe interval
and an approximately 83.3-millisecond visual delay; slow replay playback increases
the delay to cover its longer keyframe intervals. Late rendering skips overdue
visual samples and never predicts beyond the newest state. Crashes, sinking, and explosions
follow confirmed gameplay events. Interpolated state never enters replay data;
toggling F12 during a replay does not change its simulated result. Seeking,
pausing, rewinding, and camera changes reset interpolation history.

Desktop SDL3 builds use two internal presentation pages. Each complete frame is
composed into the hidden page, including its palette colors and HyperVision detail,
then flipped to the front before SDL receives it. Window exposure and resizing
repaint that completed page while the next frame is being drawn. This prevents
partial game-frame updates from reaching presentation without queuing an extra
frame. Display synchronization still depends on SDL and the graphics driver.

If fullscreen tears but a maximized window is smooth, desktop SDL3 builds can
start in a borderless maximized window with `RESTUNTS_BORDERLESS=1`:

```sh
RESTUNTS_BORDERLESS=1 ./out/sdl3-linux-x64/restunts --data-dir stunts
```

This keeps ordinary window status and uses the desktop's usable area; a panel or
dock may remain visible. Alt+Enter still toggles fullscreen, returning to the
borderless window when fullscreen is turned off. Omit the variable or set it to
`0` to start with the normal window. This option does not change interpolation,
frame pacing, or VSync. It has no effect in DOS, browser, or batch builds.
Maximization depends on window-manager support.

On Windows, Linux, BSD, and macOS, VSync is enabled by default in both windowed and fullscreen
mode, with or without HyperVision. The game requests synchronization to the display's
vertical refresh; SDL may use timed pacing when a renderer cannot synchronize.
The existing classic and 60 FPS HyperVision targets still apply. Set
`RESTUNTS_VSYNC=0` to disable it, or `RESTUNTS_VSYNC=1` to enable it explicitly.
For example, on Linux:

```sh
RESTUNTS_VSYNC=0 ./out/sdl3-linux-x64/restunts --data-dir stunts
```

In PowerShell, set `$env:RESTUNTS_VSYNC = '0'` before launching `restunts.exe`.
Unset the variable to restore the default. Invalid values warn and select the
default. If the renderer cannot apply the requested setting, the game warns and
continues. The setting does not affect DOS builds or batch dump tools. Display
synchronization waits are excluded from automatic HyperVision quality measurements.

On Windows, Linux, BSD, and macOS, HyperVision draws serially by default with zero background
render workers. Set `RESTUNTS_RENDER_WORKERS` to `1` through `7` to select a
background worker count, or `auto` to use the detected logical CPU count minus
one, capped at seven. The setting is read when the renderer initializes its
worker pool. For example, on Linux:

```sh
RESTUNTS_RENDER_WORKERS=auto ./out/sdl3-linux-x64/restunts --data-dir stunts
```

In PowerShell, use `$env:RESTUNTS_RENDER_WORKERS = 'auto'` before launching
`restunts.exe`. Unset the variable or set it to `0` to restore the default.
Small scenes remain serial even with workers enabled. The physics schedule is
independent of the worker count; DOS always renders serially. If worker creation
fails, rendering uses the available workers or runs serially. Enable workers only
when measurements on the intended machine show a useful benefit.

See [HyperVision measurement methods](docs/hypervision.md#performance-measurement)
for the current benchmark scope. The earlier
[SuperSight CPU measurements](docs/supersight-performance.md) document the previous
renderer and do not establish HyperVision performance.

Press **F11** or **Shift+F11** to toggle the diagnostic display on or off. In
SDL3 builds, it shows both FPS and render time. The FPS counter measures presented
frames over approximately one second and rounds down, for example `20 FPS`. The
render-time line shows a value such as `8.4ms`: the average
render duration of the latest 100 completed frames, or the available frames while
warming up, rounded to one decimal place. Rendering and framebuffer composition
are measured before presentation waits; physics, frame pacing, and VSync waits
are excluded. Changing renderer clears the duration history. The original 16-bit
DOS build shows only FPS. Use Shift+F11 in browsers where F11 toggles fullscreen.

The target color threshold is 20 FPS in classic mode and 60 FPS in SDL3
HyperVision. The temporary HyperVision preset message appears below the timing
line after F12 or Shift+F12, independently of F11. Automatic adaptation works
whether F11 is on or off.
F11, Shift+F11, and F12 also work in both car-selection screens and during the
nighttime driving intro without skipping the animation, including in 16-bit DOS. F12 also
works in the track preview and opponent-selection menu, with the same two-second
status display. SDL3 builds additionally support Shift+F12 in these locations.

HyperVision and the FPS display start off by default. Their selections persist
until changed or the game exits.
The renderer and display shortcuts work in all driving and replay cameras,
including opponent and ghost views and paused replays. Holding a shortcut key
changes its selection only once.

### Race against a ghost

In **Opponent**, choose **Clock**, then **Ghost** to select a replay. The game
uses the replay's track and changes the description to **Race against a Ghost.**
Your car and transmission stay selected, and you can change them before driving.
The recorded player's car follows the replay as a silent, black grille ghost;
it cannot collide with your car or change the track. At the end of the replay,
it stays in its final position. Restarting or rewinding keeps it synchronized
with your race time. Press **T** to switch between your view and the ghost's
view; **F1** through **F4** select the camera mode for either car.

Choose **Clock** again to remove the ghost. Loading a different track, changing
its layout in the editor, or selecting an AI opponent also clears the ghost.
Canceling the replay picker keeps the previous selection. The ghost selection
lasts for the current game session; saved replays retain the ordinary replay
format and do not include the ghost.

Preparing the ghost reconstructs the selected replay before driving and caches
its positions in a temporary `GHxxxxxx.TMP` file in the game directory. The game
removes this file when the selection is cleared or the game exits normally.
As with ordinary replay playback, use the physics switches used to record it.

### Rewind while driving

Hold **Q** during a race to rewind, then release it to continue driving from
that point. The race stays visible without opening the replay controls or a
menu. Rewind speed doubles after holding Q for ten seconds and stops at the
start of the available recording. Releasing Q replaces the later recording
with your new driving; the run is marked as modified, like continuing from a
replay, and does not qualify for the normal high-score table.

### Optional parameters

Run `restunts.exe --nointro` to skip the startup intro and open the main menu
immediately after initialization. The intro remains available when leaving the
main menu. This switch is case-sensitive and can be combined with the other
startup options.

Run `restunts.exe --pg:off` to correct the original power gear bug, including
anti-power gear and the loss of aerodynamic deceleration while accelerating.
Original physics remain the default for replay compatibility. `--pg:on` explicitly
selects the original behavior. These switches are case-insensitive; if both are
supplied, the last one wins. They can be combined with `--nointro` and other
startup options.

Run `restunts.exe --lc:off` to disable Legacy Collision and restore the earlier
32-bit signed interpolation for wheel collisions with walls and track planes.
Legacy collision behavior remains the default for replay compatibility; `--lc:on`
explicitly selects it. These switches are case-insensitive, and the last one
wins. They can be combined with `--pg:off`, `--nointro`, and other startup options.
With `--lc:off`, collisions also check the wheel's movement through the underside
clearance of elevated track surfaces, preventing fast cars from skipping the
collision zone behind a loop. The impact is checked against the actual surface
footprint, preserving clear passages underneath and beside it. Surfaces at both
ends of the movement are checked, including the surface a wheel just left when
moving onto the ground or another segment. Car edges between the wheels are
also checked against finite walls, catching impacts with the start of a ramp
side wall that individual wheel paths can miss. Slalom stones use their full
finite bounds for these checks, including wheel movement that crosses an entire
stone between frames. The car stops at the first contact.
With `--lc:off`, body collisions also distinguish separate surfaces that reuse
one collision-plane template. Moving from a hill into the clear space beneath
an open ramp, or between elevated surfaces at different heights, no longer
causes a false crash merely because the selected surface changes. Actual
crossings of either surface and collisions at continuous surface joins remain.
With `--lc:off`, collision-induced sideways heading offsets and opponent spin
also decay fully to zero in either direction, preventing a permanent steering
bias after contact. Legacy mode retains the original negative-rounding behavior.
Renderer clipping retains its original arithmetic.

Run `restunts.exe --lcb:off` to disable the original left corner bias: left turns
gain a stronger steering response from signed rounding in wheel-heading and skid
calculations. With the bias disabled, those angle calculations round symmetrically
for both directions. Original behavior remains the default; `--lcb:on` explicitly
selects it. These switches are case-insensitive, and the last one wins. They
can be combined with `--pg:off`, `--lc:off`, `--nointro`, and other startup
options. Collision recovery rounding remains controlled separately by `--lc:off`.

The ported physics dump tool accepts the same switches after the replay name:
`repldump.exe 0681 --pg:off --lc:off --lcb:off`. Replays do not store these
options, so use the same physics settings for recording and playback. Original
assembly executables and the renderer dump tools retain their existing interfaces.

### OWOOT driving rules

Run `restunts.exe --owoot` to require at least part of one player wheel to remain
on or above the road. The check uses the car model's tire geometry, including
steering, suspension, pitch, and roll, and is independent of camera position,
zoom, and detail level. Red-white rumble strips on large corners count as grass.
Driving beneath an elevated road does not count as being above it.

Stunts must be followed along their intended route: the switch also checks
ordered progress through loops, corkscrews, slaloms, and other stunt elements.
An airborne car may cross the single off-road tile between aligned ramps or
bridges. The whole gap tile is exempt. The exception requires a launch from
the connected approach and ends at the receiving road; it does not permit
arbitrary flights over grass. The
`r*` OWOOT replay corpus contains only single-tile gaps between connected
elevated road ends, including gaps occupied by scenery. Flight may continue
over the receiving road for additional tiles.

A violation triggers the normal crash immediately. Only the player is checked,
including during replay playback. Rewinding restores the OWOOT progress along
with the car state. The switch is case-insensitive and can be combined with
`--pg:off`, `--lc:off`, and `--nointro`; it is disabled by default.

The physics dump tool also accepts `repldump.exe <replay> --owoot`. Replays do not
store the switch, so launch with the same settings for recording and playback.
See [OWOOT validation notes](docs/owoot-validation.md) for replay audit findings.

With `--owoot`, `repldump.exe R0019.RPL --owoot` also writes `R0019.owo`, containing
exactly `pass` or `fail`. Passing requires finishing the race without an OWOOT
violation; ordinary crashes and unfinished replays fail too. The result starts
as `fail` and changes to `pass` only after successful processing. File-writing
or replay-loading errors return a nonzero exit code; check that code as well
when validating a batch. Without `--owoot`, no `.owo` file is created or updated.

### Needle colours

The ported game includes the [needle colour mod](https://wiki.stunts.hu/wiki/Needle_colour_mod).
Each car selects its dashboard needle colours through the Red #5 word
(labelled "needle colour" in CarWorks), at offset `0xAE` within its `simd`
resource. The low byte sets the speedometer colour. The high byte sets the
tachometer colour; when it is zero, the tachometer uses the low byte too.
For example, `0x040F` selects palette index 15 for the speedometer and 4 for
the tachometer. The stock value `0x0010` keeps both needles white, and
`0x0000` makes both black. Digital speedometer digits are unaffected.


## How to build

SDL3 builds support Linux, BSD, Windows, macOS, 32-bit DOS, and
[offline HTML/WebAssembly](#sdl3-webassembly-build-offline-html).

### SDL3 native builds: Linux, BSD, Windows, macOS, and 32-bit DOS

The CMake build produces the game (`restunts`), physics dumper (`repldump`),
and renderer dumper (`pixldump`) for all native targets. Run the commands below
from the repository root. Use a separate build directory for each target,
architecture, compiler, and host; do not reuse a native Windows build directory
from WSL, or vice versa.

CMake caches absolute source and build paths. If a checkout was moved, copied,
or opened through a different shared-folder mount, an existing build tree can
report that its cache or source directory does not match. Regenerate it from
your current repository path with `--fresh`, then build:

```sh
cmake --fresh -S . -B out/sdl3-linux-x64 -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build out/sdl3-linux-x64 --parallel 2
```

For other targets, use their build directory and repeat the toolchain and CPU
options from the corresponding recipe. `--fresh` clears previously cached
configuration options, so include any custom options you want to retain.

| Build host | Linux backend | Windows backend | macOS backend | DOS backend |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux x64 | Native GCC, x64 or x86 multilib | MinGW-w64 cross-compiler, x64 or x86 | Build on a Mac | DJGPP cross-compiler, 32-bit DPMI |
| Windows x64 | GCC inside WSL2 | Native MSYS2 UCRT64 for x64; MinGW-w64 inside WSL2 for x86 | Build on a Mac | Native DJGPP in MSYS2, or DJGPP inside WSL2 |
| macOS Apple Silicon or Intel | Use a Linux environment | Use a Windows or Linux environment | Apple Clang and macOS SDK; arm64, x86_64, or universal | Use a documented Linux or Windows environment |

CMake 3.25 or newer, Ninja, Git, and the selected compiler must be on `PATH`.
CMake downloads and verifies the pinned SDL3 source automatically, so the
first configure needs network access. SDL3 is linked statically by default;
no separate SDL installation is required. Desktop builds also produce the
required Nuked OPL2 shared library. MSVC is not supported by this project.

Building does not download game assets. Before running the game or the audio
tests, place the Broderbund Stunts 1.1 files in `stunts/`. `ADSKIDMS.VCE` and `DEFAULT.RPL` must be directly inside `stunts/`.

#### Linux host: prerequisites

These Bash commands target Debian 12 or Ubuntu 24.04 on x64. They also apply
inside an x64 WSL2 distribution; Windows setup is described below.

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake ninja-build git curl ca-certificates \
    pkg-config python3 unzip bzip2
```

#### Linux host: Linux backend

Install the desktop driver development libraries, then configure and build:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libx11-dev libxext-dev \
    libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxfixes-dev libxss-dev libxtst-dev \
    libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev libudev-dev libdrm-dev libgbm-dev \
    libegl1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
cmake -S . -B out/sdl3-linux-x64 -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build out/sdl3-linux-x64 --parallel 2
```

For **32-bit Linux** on the same x64 host, install multilib and the i386
versions of the driver libraries, then use the Linux x86 toolchain:

```sh
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib libasound2-dev:i386 libpulse-dev:i386 \
    libx11-dev:i386 libxext-dev:i386 libxrandr-dev:i386 libxcursor-dev:i386 \
    libxi-dev:i386 libxfixes-dev:i386 libxss-dev:i386 libxtst-dev:i386 \
    libwayland-dev:i386 libxkbcommon-dev:i386 libudev-dev:i386 libdrm-dev:i386 \
    libgbm-dev:i386 libegl1-mesa-dev:i386 libgl1-mesa-dev:i386
cmake -S . -B out/sdl3-linux-x86 -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/linux-x86.cmake
cmake --build out/sdl3-linux-x86 --parallel 2
```

The build directory contains `restunts`, `repldump`, `pixldump`, and
`libnuked-opl2.so`. After adding the game assets, test and run the x64 build:

```sh
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy \
    ctest --test-dir out/sdl3-linux-x64 --output-on-failure
out/sdl3-linux-x64/restunts --data-dir stunts --nointro
```

Use `out/sdl3-linux-x86` instead for the x86 build.

#### Linux host: Windows backend

Install MinGW-w64 and build each desired Windows architecture in its own tree:

```sh
sudo apt-get install mingw-w64
cmake -S . -B out/sdl3-windows-x64 -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/mingw-x64.cmake
cmake --build out/sdl3-windows-x64 --parallel 2
cmake -S . -B out/sdl3-windows-x86 -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/mingw-x86.cmake
cmake --build out/sdl3-windows-x86 --parallel 2
```

Each directory contains `restunts.exe`, `repldump.exe`, `pixldump.exe`, and
`nuked-opl2.dll`. Run the executables and test binaries on Windows. For a
complete transferable package, use the packaging commands below.

#### Linux host: DOS backend

Install the pinned [DJGPP GCC 12.2.0 cross-toolchain](https://github.com/andrewwutw/build-djgpp/releases/tag/v3.4).
Its Linux binaries require `libfl2`. Download and check the archive before
extracting it:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libfl2
mkdir -p out/toolchains/djgpp-linux
curl --fail --location --retry 3 \
    https://github.com/andrewwutw/build-djgpp/releases/download/v3.4/djgpp-linux64-gcc1220.tar.bz2 \
    --output out/toolchains/djgpp-linux64-gcc1220.tar.bz2
printf '%s  %s\n' 8464f17017d6ab1b2bb2df4ed82357b5bf692e6e2b7fee37e315638f3d505f00 \
    out/toolchains/djgpp-linux64-gcc1220.tar.bz2 | sha256sum -c -
tar -xjf out/toolchains/djgpp-linux64-gcc1220.tar.bz2 \
    -C out/toolchains/djgpp-linux --strip-components=1
export PATH="$PWD/out/toolchains/djgpp-linux/bin:$PATH"
cmake -S . -B out/sdl3-dos -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/djgpp.cmake -DRESTUNTS_BUILD_TESTS=OFF
cmake --build out/sdl3-dos --parallel 2
```

The outputs are `out/sdl3-dos/restunts.exe`, `repldump.exe`, and `pixldump.exe`.
These are 32-bit DOS/DPMI programs. They do not use the desktop Nuked library.
See the DOS runtime instructions below for game data and the DPMI host.

#### Windows host: Windows backend

Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) and open its **UCRT64** terminal.
Update MSYS2 first; if the updater asks you to close the terminal, reopen
UCRT64 and run the update again. Then install the native Windows tools:

```sh
pacman -Syu
pacman -S --needed git mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc \
    mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-ninja
```

Change to the repository root in that terminal (for example,
`cd /c/src/restunts-bb11` for a checkout at `C:\src\restunts-bb11`). Select
UCRT64's native GCC directly; the MinGW toolchain files above are for Linux
cross-compilation:

```sh
cmake -S . -B out/sdl3-windows-x64-msys2 -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++
cmake --build out/sdl3-windows-x64-msys2 --parallel 2
```

After adding game assets, run the native tests and game in the same terminal:

```sh
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy \
    ctest --test-dir out/sdl3-windows-x64-msys2 --output-on-failure
./out/sdl3-windows-x64-msys2/restunts.exe --data-dir stunts
```

Keep `nuked-opl2.dll` beside the three `.exe` files. For **Windows x86** from a
Windows host, use WSL2 and the Linux-host Windows x86 recipe above. UCRT64 is
a 64-bit toolchain; use the separate i686 MinGW-w64 compiler for x86.

#### Windows host: Linux backend with WSL2

Install an x64 Linux environment with
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
In an **Administrator PowerShell** window, run:

```powershell
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04
```

Restart Windows if requested and complete Ubuntu's first-run username/password
setup. Open the distribution from PowerShell:

```powershell
wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04
```

The resulting shell is **Linux Bash**. Open your checkout there, or clone the
branch you want to build into the Linux filesystem. A Windows checkout such as
`C:\src\restunts-bb11` is accessible with `cd /mnt/c/src/restunts-bb11`, but a
checkout under your WSL home directory avoids cross-filesystem build overhead.

Run **Linux host: prerequisites** and **Linux host: Linux backend** above for
Linux x64 or x86 executables. The same WSL shell can also run **Linux host:
Windows backend** for Windows x64/x86 and **Linux host: DOS backend** for DOS.
All three recipes use Linux tools inside WSL; their target executables retain
the selected backend's format. Use fresh build directories if the checkout has
already been built with native Windows tools. The pinned `linux64` DJGPP archive
requires an x64 Linux environment, not an ARM64 WSL distribution.

#### Windows host: DOS backend

In the **MSYS2 UCRT64** terminal configured above, install download/extraction
tools and get the standalone Windows DJGPP toolchain. This archive includes
its required Windows DLLs:

```sh
pacman -S --needed curl unzip
mkdir -p out/toolchains/djgpp-windows
curl --fail --location --retry 3 \
    https://github.com/andrewwutw/build-djgpp/releases/download/v3.4/djgpp-mingw-gcc1220-standalone.zip \
    --output out/toolchains/djgpp-mingw-gcc1220-standalone.zip
printf '%s  %s\n' 6f88b531d216f4d92668c960b5cde9a829b5611e06d2c3e431041e33f01c1a52 \
    out/toolchains/djgpp-mingw-gcc1220-standalone.zip | sha256sum -c -
unzip -q out/toolchains/djgpp-mingw-gcc1220-standalone.zip \
    -d out/toolchains/djgpp-windows
export PATH="$PWD/out/toolchains/djgpp-windows/djgpp/bin:$PATH"
cmake -S . -B out/sdl3-dos-windows -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/djgpp.cmake -DRESTUNTS_BUILD_TESTS=OFF
cmake --build out/sdl3-dos-windows --parallel 2
```

The same three DOS executables are created in `out/sdl3-dos-windows/`.
The WSL2 route above is also available and uses the same Linux DJGPP toolchain
as CI. DOS tests are disabled in these builds because DOS executables cannot
be run directly by the host's CTest process.

#### macOS host: macOS backend

The macOS target uses the shared SDL3 backend with Apple's native window,
input, audio, and graphics drivers. Build on a Mac with the Xcode Command Line
Tools and the macOS SDK. The helper script targets macOS 11.0 or newer on both
Apple Silicon (`arm64`) and Intel (`x86_64`). That is a build setting; older
macOS releases still require runtime testing.

In Terminal, install Apple's tools, complete the installer, then install
CMake 3.25+, Ninja, Git, and Python 3 using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake ninja git python
```

Homebrew must already be installed and on `PATH`. SDL3 itself is fetched and
built by CMake; a Homebrew SDL installation is not needed. From the repository
root, build and package for the Mac running the command:

```sh
bash tools/scripts/build-macos.sh
```

The script selects `arm64` or `x86_64` from the current shell architecture,
builds Release executables in `out/sdl3-macos-<arch>/`, and installs the complete
runtime into `out/package-macos-<arch>/`. On Apple Silicon, use a native Terminal
or select `--arch arm64` explicitly if the shell runs through Rosetta.
To select an architecture or create a universal package for both CPU families:

```sh
bash tools/scripts/build-macos.sh --arch arm64
bash tools/scripts/build-macos.sh --arch x86_64
bash tools/scripts/build-macos.sh --arch universal
```

Each selection has a separate build and package directory. A universal build
contains both architectures in every executable and the audio library. CMake's
[`CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES.html)
and [SDL's macOS build guide](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/README-macos) describe
this mechanism. Test each architecture on a matching Mac; an Intel-only build
needs Rosetta to run on Apple Silicon, and an arm64-only build cannot run on Intel.

Use `--jobs 4` to change build parallelism, or `--build-dir DIR` and
`--package-dir DIR` to choose output folders. Additional CMake options follow
`--`, for example `-- -DRESTUNTS_BUILD_TESTS=OFF`. To change the minimum OS,
set `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` before configuring a fresh build directory.

To configure manually instead, this example targets Apple Silicon:

```sh
cmake -S . -B out/sdl3-macos-arm64 -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER="$(xcrun --find clang)" \
    -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64 -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0
cmake --build out/sdl3-macos-arm64 --parallel 2
cmake --install out/sdl3-macos-arm64 --prefix out/package-macos-arm64 --component Runtime
```

Use `x86_64` in both directory names and the architecture option for Intel;
use `universal` in the directory names and
`'-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64;x86_64'` for a universal build.
The build directory contains `restunts`, `repldump`, `pixldump`, and
`libnuked-opl2.dylib`. The package keeps executables in `bin/`, the replaceable
audio library in `lib/`, and enhanced artwork beside the executables.

After placing the original game data in `stunts/`, run the native tests and game:

```sh
bash tools/scripts/build-macos.sh --arch arm64 --test
bash tools/scripts/run-macos.sh --runtime-dir out/package-macos-arm64 \
    --data-dir stunts -- --nointro
```

Replace `arm64` with `x86_64` on Intel. `--test` uses SDL's dummy video/audio
drivers for CTest and requires the game fixtures described above. To run tests
without rebuilding:

```sh
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy \
    ctest --test-dir out/sdl3-macos-arm64 --output-on-failure
```

The launcher also accepts the build directory with `--runtime-dir`.

The **PR validation** and **Release** workflows build one Universal package for
Apple Silicon and Intel, targeting macOS 11.0 or newer. The
`packages-macos-universal` artifact contains `restunts-macos-universal.tar.gz`,
which preserves executable permissions. CI runs game tests on native Linux
and/or 16-bit DOS; the macOS job builds and checks package contents.

#### macOS: running an already compiled package

No compiler, Homebrew, CMake, or separate SDL installation is needed for the
default runtime package. Download `restunts-macos-universal.tar.gz` from a
release for either Apple Silicon or Intel. When downloading the
`packages-macos-universal` CI artifact instead, unzip its outer GitHub Actions
archive first. Extract the runtime archive to a writable folder:

```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/Games/restunts"
tar -xzf "$HOME/Downloads/restunts-macos-universal.tar.gz" -C "$HOME/Games/restunts"
```

Keep the entire extracted package together, including `bin/`, `lib/`, `share/`,
and `run-restunts.sh`.
Copy your original Broderbund Stunts 1.1 data into a separate writable folder,
for example `$HOME/Games/Stunts-data`, with `MISC.RES` (or `MISC.PRE`),
`ADSKIDMS.VCE`, tracks, cars, and the other game resources directly inside it.
Then launch from Terminal:

```sh
bash "$HOME/Games/restunts/run-restunts.sh" \
    --data-dir "$HOME/Games/Stunts-data" -- --nointro
```

Omit `-- --nointro` to watch the intro, or pass other game arguments after `--`,
for example `-- --hv:medium`. The launcher finds its own package regardless of
the terminal's working directory. The equivalent direct command is:

```sh
"$HOME/Games/restunts/bin/restunts" --data-dir "$HOME/Games/Stunts-data" --nointro
```

Saved games, replays, and dump outputs go into the selected game-data folder.
Use `repldump` or `pixldump` from the same `bin/` folder with their normal
arguments. The runtime is a Terminal-launched program; there is no Finder
`.app` bundle. On keyboards that assign system actions to function keys, use
Fn/Globe with F11/F12 for the game's timing and HyperVision controls.

#### BSD hosts: FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD

The shared SDL3 backend has these native release targets:

| Target | Build environment |
| --- | --- |
| `freebsd-x64` | FreeBSD 14.4, amd64 |
| `openbsd-x64` | OpenBSD 7.9, amd64 |
| `netbsd-x64` | NetBSD 10.2, amd64 |
| `netbsd-x86` | NetBSD 10.2, i386 userspace; SSE2 enabled |
| `netbsd-x86-no-sse2` | NetBSD 10.2, i386 userspace; SSE2 disabled |

Each target produces a separate `.tar.gz` archive. Build on the matching BSD;
Linux binaries and libraries cannot be used for these native targets. See the
[BSD build instructions](docs/sdl3.md#bsd) for dependencies, local builds, and
package creation. CI uses BSD virtual machines; the NetBSD x86 jobs build in
an i386 userspace inside the amd64 VM.

#### SDL3 build options, packages, and DOS runtime

Desktop regression binaries are built by default. Add
`-DRESTUNTS_BUILD_TESTS=OFF` at configure time if you only need the game and
dump tools. Run CTest in the native build environment. For cross-builds, run
the test binaries on the target OS; generated CTest files refer to the original
build and source paths.

For a **32-bit Linux, Windows, or NetBSD build without SSE2**, add
`-DRESTUNTS_SSE2=OFF` to its configure command and choose another build tree
(for example, `out/sdl3-linux-x86-nosse2`). This disables SSE/SSE2/AVX in the
game, Nuked, and bundled SDL. x64 requires SSE2; DOS uses the i386 baseline
and disables SSE2 by default. `-DRESTUNTS_SYSTEM_SDL=ON` can use an installed
SDL3 CMake package instead of the pinned source, but cannot be combined with
`RESTUNTS_SSE2=OFF`.

Install a complete runtime package from the build directory you used:

```sh
cmake --install out/sdl3-linux-x64 --prefix out/package-linux-x64 --component Runtime
cmake --install out/sdl3-windows-x64 --prefix out/package-windows-x64 --component Runtime
cmake --install out/sdl3-dos --prefix out/package-dos --component Runtime
```

Run only the install commands for targets you built. For native Windows
builds, substitute `out/sdl3-windows-x64-msys2` or `out/sdl3-dos-windows` as
the build directory. Packages contain `bin/` executables, the desktop Nuked
library in Linux/BSD/macOS `lib/` or Windows `bin/`, and dependency sources/notices under
`share/`. Keep the complete package together when moving or distributing it.
Game data is separate; desktop programs accept `--data-dir stunts` as their
first option when launched from the repository root.

For DOS, copy the three executables from the package's `bin/` into a separate
DOS game directory with the Stunts resources and the enhanced artwork folders.
CI and release DOS32 packages include [CWSDPMI.EXE](https://sandmann.dotster.com/cwsdpmi/)
in `bin/`; copy it beside the executables too. For a manual CMake install, add
a compatible DPMI host if the DOS environment does not provide one. Mount that directory in DOSBox/DOSBox-X, set
`core=dynamic`, `cycles=max`, and `aspect=true`, then run `RESTUNTS.EXE`.
Stop automated DOSBox runs with SIGKILL to avoid the shutdown confirmation.

See [the SDL3 guide](docs/sdl3.md) for controls, audio details, package contents,
and native replay validation.

### SDL3 WebAssembly build: offline HTML

This target produces a single `restunts.html` that opens directly in a browser
without a web server. It embeds the program, enhanced skyboxes, and enhanced
opponent portraits. **Original game files, including tracks and cars, are not
included** and are not needed to build the HTML. Players supply their own game
folder when starting it.

Install CMake 3.25+, Ninja, Git, Python 3, and the
[Emscripten SDK](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html).
The commands below use the tested Emscripten **6.0.10**. Install and activate the
SDK once; load its environment again in each new terminal. If you already have
that SDK installed, use its location instead of cloning another copy.

#### Linux host: WebAssembly backend

These Bash commands also work inside WSL2. Keep the SDK on a filesystem that
supports symbolic links, such as your Linux home directory. From the repository
root:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git "$HOME/emsdk"
"$HOME/emsdk/emsdk" install 6.0.10
"$HOME/emsdk/emsdk" activate 6.0.10
. "$HOME/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh"
emcmake cmake -S . -B out/sdl3-wasm -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build out/sdl3-wasm --parallel 2
```

The output is `out/sdl3-wasm/restunts.html`.

#### Windows host: WebAssembly backend

Use **Command Prompt** with CMake, Ninja, Git, and Python 3 on `PATH`.
Run from the repository root and using a different build directory than other builds (e.g. WSL2):

```bat
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git "%USERPROFILE%\emsdk"
call "%USERPROFILE%\emsdk\emsdk.bat" install 6.0.10
call "%USERPROFILE%\emsdk\emsdk.bat" activate 6.0.10
call "%USERPROFILE%\emsdk\emsdk_env.bat"
call emcmake cmake -S . -B out/sdl3-wasm-windows -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build out/sdl3-wasm-windows --parallel 2
```

The output is `out/sdl3-wasm-windows/restunts.html`. The browser build produces
only the game; native dump tools and regression executables are disabled.

#### Run and package the HTML

Copy `restunts.html` into your own Stunts game folder and open it in a browser.
Click **Choose game folder**, select that folder, then click **Start game**.
Supported browsers remember the selected folder and may ask you to **Allow folder
access** again when reopening the HTML. Use **Change game folder** to select a
different folder. These browsers can save directly after read/write permission;
others require folder selection each time and show save import/export controls.

To create the distribution package from a Linux/WSL2 build:

```sh
cmake --install out/sdl3-wasm --prefix out/package-wasm --component Runtime
```

For a native Windows build, replace `out/sdl3-wasm` with
`out/sdl3-wasm-windows`. Distribute the complete package, including dependency
licenses and the Nuked OPL2 relink kit. It contains no original game data.
See [the browser build guide](docs/wasm.md) for browser support, saving, and tests.

### Original 16-bit DOS builds with Open Watcom

The DOS compiler, assembler, and linker are Open Watcom 2, pinned to the official
[2026-09-01 build](https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2/releases/tag/2026-09-01-Build).
The setup scripts verify its SHA256 and install into ignored `tools/watcom/`.
The shared release pin is `tools/scripts/open-watcom.conf`. WCC, WASM, WLINK,
and GNU Make 4.3 or newer run natively on Linux or Windows. The standard build
does not require Wine or DOSBox. Python 3.9 or newer is required for the
`*-original` targets, which prepare assembler-compatible copies of the
preserved original sources.

Git is required for the ported game builds. The Options menu shows
`Chocolate Stunts` and `Version <githash> (Mmm dd yyyy)`, using the first seven
characters of the checkout's commit and the compilation date (for example,
`Version d37a5c8 (Sep 18 2026)`). Incremental builds refresh both the commit
and compilation date.

#### On Windows

1. Install the toolchain from PowerShell at the repository root (Windows 10/11
   `tar.exe` and PowerShell are required):

   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\scripts\install-open-watcom.ps1
   ```

2. In cmd.exe at the repository root, run:

   ```text
   cd src\restunts
   setpath
   make restunts repldump pixldump
   ```

3. To build the original game and both dump tools from source as
   `stunts/restunto.exe`, `stunts/repldumo.exe`, and `stunts/pixldumo.exe`,
   install Python 3.9 or newer and run in the same cmd.exe window:

   ```text
   make restunts-original repldump-original pixldump-original
   ```

#### On Linux (x86-64)

1. Install GNU Make 4.3 or newer, Bash, curl, tar, xz, and
   coreutils. Run the setup script from the repository root:

   ```sh
   tools/scripts/install-open-watcom.sh
   ```

2. Build with native GNU Make:

   ```sh
   make -C src/restunts restunts repldump pixldump
   ```

3. To build the original game and both dump tools from source as
   `stunts/restunto.exe`, `stunts/repldumo.exe`, and `stunts/pixldumo.exe`,
   run from the repository root after installing Python 3.9 or newer:

   ```sh
   make -C src/restunts restunts-original repldump-original pixldump-original
   ```

The makefiles use `python3` on Linux and `python` on Windows; override
`PYTHON` if needed.

#### On both platforms

Build outputs are copied to `stunts/`.

The supported targets are:

| Target | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `restunts` | Builds `restunts.exe` from the ported C game and DOS platform layer. |
| `restunts-original` | Assembles the original game and links `restunto.exe` with WLINK. |
| `repldump` | Builds the C physics dump tool, `repldump.exe`. |
| `pixldump` | Builds the C renderer dump tool, `pixldump.exe`. |
| `repldump-original` | Builds `repldumo.exe` from the original assembly and physics dump wrapper. |
| `pixldump-original` | Builds `pixldumo.exe` from the original assembly and renderer dump wrapper. |
| `test-dos-platform` | Builds the DOS platform ABI test, `tests/build/watcom/<configuration>/DOSPLAT.EXE`. |
| `test-race-memory` | Builds the full-game race memory test, `tests/build/watcom/<configuration>/RACEMEM.EXE`. |
| `clean` | Removes generated build objects and candidate executables. |

The `*-original` dump targets assemble the original game code with WASM,
compile the dump wrappers with WCC, and link them with WLINK. The resulting
executables are rebuilt development tools. CI uses the independent Borland
`repldumo.exe` and `pixldumo.exe` preserved under
[tools/oracles/borland](tools/oracles/borland/README.md), whose SHA256 hashes
are recorded alongside them. The archived renderer captures every frame
incrementally. Source builds never replace the archived files.

The original game assembly under `src/restunts/asmorig/` is preserved
unchanged. The WASM build runs
[the source adapter](tools/scripts/prepare-wasm-original.py) to prepare
compatible copies under `asmorig/build/watcom/<configuration>/wasm/source/`.
All three `*-original` targets reuse these objects. The `restunto.exe` link
response file reproduces the original segment order, disables automatic segment packing,
and preserves the original 8000-byte stack. The old empty `segments.obj`
layout helper is replaced by WLINK ordering directives; its ASM source is
retained unchanged.

See [the assembler guide](docs/assembler.md) for generated-source handling,
original-code layout requirements, and object/executable comparison commands.

`makerepldump.bat` builds both games and both physics dump tools;
`makepixldump.bat` builds both renderer dump tools. Both stop on build errors.

`pixldump-original` builds `stunts/pixldumo.exe` from the original game assembly
and the current capture wrapper. Local `pixelcheck.sh` runs use the renderer
reference in `stunts/`. `validate-toolchain.py` takes it from
`--candidate-directory`, which defaults to `stunts/`, and uses the archived
physics oracle. CI copies both archived Borland oracles into its isolated
test directory after copying the source-built executables.

#### Assembler

All assembly targets use Open Watcom WASM from the same pinned installation
as WCC and WLINK, with 8086 code generation. `-zcm=tasm` selects WASM's
built-in compatibility mode for the preserved assembly syntax; it does not
require the Turbo Assembler tools.

#### Compiler, linker, and debugging symbols

All DOS C targets use Open Watcom 2 WCC and WLINK. `LINKER=wlink` is the only
supported linker setting. `setpath.bat` puts the pinned Watcom tools before
bundled utilities on PATH and sets `WATCOM` and `INCLUDE` accordingly.

Shared flags live in `src/restunts/watcom.mk`: 8086 instructions, the medium
memory model (far code and near data), the stack-based C calling convention,
signed `char`, and byte-packed structures. These settings preserve the
original game's 16-bit data layout and assembly interfaces. The custom DOS
startup initializes the stack and BSS; compiler stack probes are disabled.
The runtime libraries and headers come from the same pinned Watcom release.
Portable game C uses size optimization (`-os`). The DOS platform layer and
startup are compiled without optimization (`-od`) because the pinned compiler
can incorrectly merge branches around inline assembly interrupt calls.
DOS resource pointers are explicitly normalized to a paragraph plus an offset
below 16 bytes before they reach fixed-segment sprite code.
[Watcom huge-pointer arithmetic](https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2/blob/2026-09-01-Build/bld/clib/cgsupp/a/pia.asm)
preserves larger offsets; normalization retains the Borland representation
and prevents bitmap reads from wrapping at a 64 KiB boundary.

Use `CONFIG=debug` to request Watcom C debug information. C optimization is
disabled except for the original renderer wrapper described below:

```text
make CONFIG=debug restunts
```

For `pixldump-original`, `pixldump.c` and `murmur3.c` retain size optimization
(`-os`) and use line debugging (`-d1`) without local-variable information.
This preserves the release code generation and stack layout required by the
original rendering code. Other objects use their usual debug flags.

WLINK writes Watcom debug information; debug builds also request WASM line
information.

#### The toolchain

| Purpose | Active tool |
| --- | --- |
| 16-bit DOS C compilation | Open Watcom 2 `binnt/wcc.exe` or native Linux `binl64/wcc` |
| 16-bit DOS linking | Open Watcom 2 `binnt/wlink.exe` or native Linux `binl64/wlink` |
| C headers and runtime | Open Watcom 2 `h/` and `lib286/` |
| Assembly | Open Watcom 2 `binnt/wasm.exe` or native Linux `binl64/wasm` |
| Build orchestration | GNU Make 4.3 or newer (bundled 4.4.1 on Windows) |
| Original-source preparation | Python 3.9 or newer, for the `*-original` targets with WASM |
| Running and testing | DOSBox / DOSBox-X |

Current makefiles select Watcom executables by their full installation paths.
Open Watcom supplies all C headers and runtime libraries. Regression oracles
retain their original Borland-built machine code.

#### Debugging restunts.exe

`CONFIG=debug` builds Watcom debug information and writes linker map files
beside the executables. Use a debugger that supports Watcom's format.

## pixldump

pixldump and pixldumo use the same mandatory parameters. The number of
parameters selects the output mode:

```text
pixldump.exe <replay> <camera> <target>
pixldump.exe <replay> <camera> <target> <frame>

pixldumo.exe <replay> <camera> <target>
pixldumo.exe <replay> <camera> <target> <frame>
```

| Parameter | Accepted values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `replay` | Replay base name, `.rpl`, or `.RPL` filename | Replay to render. The extension may be omitted. |
| `camera` | `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4` | Selects F1, F2, F3, or F4 respectively. |
| `target` | `0` or `1` | Selects the player (`0`) or opponent (`1`). Opponent mode requires a replay containing an opponent. |
| `frame` | `0` through `65535` | Exact frame to render. It must not exceed the replay's final frame. Supplying it selects BMP mode. |

With three parameters, the tools generate the normal hash dump. pixldumo writes
`<replay>.PDO` and pixldump writes `<replay>.PDD`. The first line is `PIXLDUMP 2`,
terminated by CRLF, identifying capture with incremental redraws on every frame.
Each subsequent CRLF-terminated row
contains the decimal frame number, one space, and the MurmurHash3_x86_32 of the
raw 64,000-byte Mode 13h framebuffer, with seed 0. The hash is eight lowercase
hexadecimal digits, most significant digit first, including leading zeroes.
The tools hash every frame from frame 0 through the replay's final frame.
Old full-redraw, MD5, and five-frame sampled dumps are incompatible; the
regression runner rejects their missing version header or missing frames and
regenerates them automatically.

With four parameters, the tools generate only the requested 320x200 indexed BMP
using the game's VGA palette. The filename includes the camera, target, frame,
and renderer:

```text
<replay>.<camera>.<target>.<frame>.PDO.bmp
<replay>.<camera>.<target>.<frame>.PDD.bmp
```

For example, `default.2.0.5.PDD.bmp` is frame 5 from the ported renderer, using
the F2 helicopter camera and following the player.

Examples:

```text
REM Generate a player/F2 hash dump.
pixldump.exe default.rpl 2 0

REM Generate an opponent/F4 hash dump with the original renderer.
pixldumo.exe default.rpl 4 1

REM Generate a player/F1 BMP at frame 5.
pixldump.exe default.rpl 1 0 5
```

pixldump must reproduce the original renderer, including its bugs. In particular,
polygon depth averages use unsigned division for non-power-of-two vertex counts
even when near-plane clipping retains a negative depth sum. This can put a grille
behind opaque surfaces, as in `0027.rpl`, camera 2, player, frame 665. Preserve
this behavior in the C port; the original engine in `asmorig` remains the oracle.

Opponent route selection also preserves original resource overreads. Track tile
IDs index the opponent's `sped` data beyond its 16 speed entries, into following
resource chunks and bytes left by decompression. The route loader reconstructs
these bytes in a fresh, zero-initialized allocation, retaining the original
compressed-source placement and enough owned tail storage for every byte-sized
index. Ordinary cached resources have discarded this tail and cannot supply it.
Clamping costs at the declared resource size changes route choices: in
`0034.rpl`, it selects the alternate branch and first diverges at frame 943.
Do not replace the reconstruction with either zero costs or reads from adjacent
allocations. Host tests cover decoder residue and poisoned memory; the golden
replays cover the resulting opponent behavior.

The C renderer also preserves the original sphere bounding-box writes used by
crash explosions and the renderer stack values reused by stopped-wheel physics.
The pixel-dump wrapper supplies the archived caller context, deriving addresses
from the DOS load segment, decoded arguments, and resource allocations. See
[renderer parity notes](docs/renderer-parity.md) for the assembly evidence and
regression coverage.

Both modes render every frame from frame 0 with incremental redraws, maximum
graphical detail, and hidden dashboard and replay controls. BMP capture retains
the preceding framebuffer history up to the requested frame. Invalid arguments
are rejected before an output file is created. The
complete output path, including its generated suffix, must fit in 127
characters. BMP filenames require DOS long-filename support; the supplied
`tools/scripts/dosbox.proc.conf` enables it for DOSBox-X.

## pixelcheck

On Linux, `pixelcheck.sh` builds or reuses both executables, runs them with the
same replay, camera, target, and optional BMP frame, and compares the resulting
files:

```text
tools/scripts/pixelcheck.sh <replay-file> <rebuild> <camera> <target>
tools/scripts/pixelcheck.sh <replay-file> <rebuild> <camera> <target> <frame>
```

| Parameter | Accepted values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `replay-file` | Replay filename under `stunts/` | Replay passed to both executables. |
| `rebuild` | `true` or `false` | `true` rebuilds both executables first; `false` reuses the existing executables in `stunts/`. |
| `camera` | `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4` | Camera passed to both executables: F1, F2, F3, or F4 respectively. |
| `target` | `0` or `1` | Player (`0`) or opponent (`1`) passed to both executables. |
| `frame` | `0` through `65535` | Present in the BMP form only. It selects the exact frame compared by both executables. |

Examples:

```text
# Rebuild both executables and compare player/F2 hash dumps.
tools/scripts/pixelcheck.sh 0610.rpl true 2 0

# Reuse existing executables and compare opponent/F4 hash dumps.
tools/scripts/pixelcheck.sh 0610.rpl false 4 1

# Reuse existing executables and compare player/F1 BMPs at frame 5.
tools/scripts/pixelcheck.sh 0610.rpl false 1 0 5
```

Set the `PIXELDUMP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` environment variable to a positive integer
to override the default 120-second timeout for each DOSBox run.


## C coding style

Project `.c` and `.h` files under `src/` use tabs with a width of four columns,
a 100-column target, K&R braces (function opening braces on their own line),
and a required braced body for every `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, and `do`.
Conventional `else if` chains are allowed. Empty loops also need braces. Keep
CRLF line endings, as required by `.gitattributes`.

C sources use the C99 features supported by Open Watcom (`-zastd=c99`).
Declare local variables close to their first use, combining the declaration
and first assignment when possible. Keep declarations in the enclosing scope
when values are shared across branches or loops, and preserve initialization
order and object lifetime.

Two standard tools check the style directly:

- [editorconfig-checker](https://github.com/editorconfig-checker/editorconfig-checker)
  reads the whitespace rules in `.editorconfig`. Its Python package installs
  the `ec` command. `.editorconfig-checker.json` limits discovery to `src/`
  and permits alignment spaces after indentation tabs. Only C/H files have
  EditorConfig rules.
- [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) reads C layout
  and brace rules from `.clang-format`. Keep its whitespace settings consistent
  with `.editorconfig`. Include order is preserved.

Install the pinned tools once in a Python virtual environment:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
# Linux/macOS:
. .venv/bin/activate
# Windows cmd.exe: .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
python -m pip install -r tools/scripts/requirements-format.txt
```

From the repository root, check against `.editorconfig` with one command:

```sh
ec
```

Check C formatting too (Bash or Git Bash):

```sh
git ls-files -z 'src/*.c' 'src/*.h' | xargs -0 -r clang-format --dry-run --Werror
```

Format all tracked project C/H files:

```sh
git ls-files -z 'src/*.c' 'src/*.h' | xargs -0 -r clang-format -i
```

For an individual file, use `clang-format -i path/to/file.c`. Add new files to
Git before running the commands based on `git ls-files`. CI runs both checks
for pull requests and before releases. No project-specific formatter or checker
script is needed.

Braces are required even where clang-format cannot insert them automatically,
including macro bodies, empty loops, and bodies spanning preprocessor
branches. Review those cases manually; a successful clang-format check does
not prove that those cases have braces.

## C# coding style

The regression application and its tests under `tools/scripts/dumpsrv` use four-space
indentation, opening braces on their own line, braced control-flow bodies, a
100-column target, and CRLF line endings. `.editorconfig` defines these rules.
Use the .NET 10 SDK to check or apply formatting:

```sh
dotnet format tools/scripts/dumpsrv/dumpsrv.slnx --verify-no-changes
dotnet format tools/scripts/dumpsrv/dumpsrv.slnx
```

## CI packages and releases

**PR validation** and **Release** build all 18 distribution packages: 16-bit and
32-bit DOS; Linux ARMv7, ARM64, x86 with and without SSE2, and x64; Windows ARM64,
x86 with and without SSE2, and x64; FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD x64; NetBSD x86
with and without SSE2; Universal macOS; and the offline browser.
The reusable **Build release packages** workflow is used by **PR validation** and **Release**.

Packages contain the runtime dependencies and enhanced artwork, but no original
game data. Desktop and browser packages include the Nuked sources and license;
DOS uses hardware OPL and omits Nuked. DOS32 also includes CWSDPMI.

A release publishes the exact archives downloaded from its build artifacts,
after verifying their checksums and signed build provenance. Immutable releases
lock the published assets and source tag. See [release packages and verification](docs/releases.md)
for the platform baselines, package contents, and verification commands.

## CI replay validation

CI runs in five phases, each requiring the previous phase to pass:

1. C/H formatting, C# regression service tests, host regression tests, native
   sanitizer regressions, and shard planning run in parallel.
2. Build the selected platforms: DOS executables with timer/cleanup checks,
   or the Linux x64 SDL3 game and dump tools with platform regressions.
3. Run all physics replay shards for the selected platforms and validate coverage.
4. Run renderer replay shards and validate coverage for each selected platform,
   camera, and target.
5. Publish a combined physics/renderer report for each selected platform,
   camera, and target. DOS uses `partitions_all-cam<camera>-target<target>`;
   SDL3 uses the same name with an `sdl3-` prefix.

A failed phase skips the later phases. Physics and renderer phase diagnostics
remain available in their individual artifacts if replay validation fails.

AddressSanitizer, ThreadSanitizer, and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer each build
and run the host and SDL3 regression suites in a separate Linux x64 job,
including the renderer-worker and audio tests. These checks run for every
platform selection and gate both PR validation and releases. Each job uses
debug symbols, frame pointers, and fail-on-error sanitizer settings. ASan uses
Clang 18 and also checks for leaks; TSan and UBSan use GCC. The ASan linker
flags preserve removal of unused fixture data while retaining checks on all
globals that remain in the executable. Bundled SDL3 and Nuked are instrumented
along with the game and tests. Test logs are retained in `sanitizer-<sanitizer>-logs`
artifacts, including on failure. TSan's runner lowers ASLR mapping entropy
to keep its shadow-memory range available. Sanitizer jobs allow ten minutes
per replay subprocess and thirty minutes per CTest entry. Normal replay tests
retain their two-minute limit (five minutes with `--full`); set
`RESTUNTS_RENDER_REPLAY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` to override it with a positive integer.

To reproduce ASan locally on Linux, install `clang-18`, `libclang-rt-18-dev`,
and `llvm-18`. Use a fresh build directory and keep `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` set
while running CTest so the standalone host tests receive the same instrumentation.
Original game data must be present in `stunts/`, as for the normal SDL3 regressions:

```sh
export CC=clang-18
export LDFLAGS=-Wl,-z,start-stop-gc
export CFLAGS='-O2 -g -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fno-sanitize-recover=all'
export ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1:halt_on_error=1
export ASAN_SYMBOLIZER_PATH=/usr/bin/llvm-symbolizer-18
export TSAN_OPTIONS=halt_on_error=1
export UBSAN_OPTIONS=halt_on_error=1:print_stacktrace=1
export RESTUNTS_RENDER_REPLAY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=600
cmake -S . -B out/sanitizer-address -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
    -DRESTUNTS_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build out/sanitizer-address --parallel 2
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy \
    ctest --test-dir out/sanitizer-address --output-on-failure --no-tests=error --timeout 1800
```

Replace `address` with `thread` or `undefined` in both the flag and build
directory for the other sanitizers, and use `CC=gcc` to match CI. The host
runner accepts `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` as whitespace-separated arguments,
without shell evaluation. TSan on Linux hosts with high ASLR entropy may
need `sudo sysctl -w vm.mmap_rnd_bits=28`, as in CI, before running the tests.
Use a separate shell or unset the exported variables before ordinary builds.

The `platforms` input selects the replay-test builds, tests, and reports. It is a
nonempty JSON array of unique names from `dos` and `sdl3`. **Build and validate**,
**PR validation**, and **Release** default to `["sdl3"]`. For example:

- `platforms: '["dos"]'` selects DOS only.
- `platforms: '["sdl3"]'` selects Linux x64 SDL3 only.
- `platforms: '["dos","sdl3"]'` selects both.

Unknown names, duplicates, and empty arrays fail validation before building.
Unselected replay platforms are skipped. **PR validation** and **Release**
always build every distribution package, including the DOS executables, even
when replay tests select only SDL3. The package matrix does not run game tests
on additional operating systems or architectures.

Physics covers the full golden replay set; renderer tests use the configured
percentage (the reusable and manual workflows default to 100%). Both DOS and
SDL3 dump tools use the same golden corpus, plans for each target, archived
Borland oracles, complete-output checks, and byte-for-byte
comparisons (`.BNI` against `.BIN`, `.PDD` against `.PDO`). SDL3 candidates run
natively on Linux x64 with dummy video and audio drivers; missing references
are still generated by the preserved DOS executables through DOSBox-X.
The `cameras` input is a nonempty JSON array of unique camera IDs from 1
through 4, defaulting to `[1,2,3,4]` in all three workflows. The `targets`
input is a nonempty JSON array of unique target IDs: player (`0`) and opponent
(`1`), defaulting to `[0,1]`. Use `targets: '[0]'` for the player alone or
`targets: '[1]'` for the opponent alone. Invalid IDs, duplicates, and empty
arrays fail validation before building.
These inputs are available in the manual **PR validation** and **Release**
workflows and passed to **Build and validate**, which calls **Replay tests**
for each selected platform, camera, and target. For example,
`cameras: '[1,2,3,4]'` with `targets: '[0,1]'` runs eight **Renderer replays**
jobs per platform. Pull-request runs use the fallback values in
`pr-validation.yml`.

Physics runs once per selected platform. Its report uses the first selected
camera and target as metadata and is reused for every renderer combination.
Every selected platform and camera uses the same plan for a given target.
Renderer percentage, shard count, worker count, and timeout inputs apply
equally to DOS and SDL3. A failed renderer job does not cancel the others.
The final reports require every selected platform, camera, and target to
pass. Each report combines that platform's physics diagnostics with its
selected camera and target's renderer diagnostics. Opponent rendering selects
only replays containing an opponent.

Each CI shard verifies the archived checksums and uses the preserved Borland
dump executables to generate missing references. Renderer shards download
`PDOs-cam<camera>-target<target>.zip` for the selected camera and target.
Physics shards download `BINs.zip` from oracle release `v1.0.4`. Oracle
downloads run for both targets. Unavailable or failed cache downloads produce
a warning and allow testing to continue. Missing or invalid references are
generated locally. Renderer cache metadata records the camera and target so
a changed view cannot reuse an incompatible reference.

The C# application in `tools/scripts/dumpsrv` runs these comparisons on Linux, Windows,
and GitHub Actions. Its HTTP service, direct runner, and report merger share the
same engine. See the [service and runner guide](tools/scripts/dumpsrv/README.md)
for publishing, service parameters, client options, and local execution.

Set `renderer-test-percentage` (an integer from 1 to 100) when manually
starting **PR validation** or **Release** to change renderer coverage. Calls
to the reusable `build-and-validate.yml` workflow can set the same input;
pull-request events use the fallback in `pr-validation.yml` (currently
100% for cameras 1 through 4, both targets, and SDL3). The HTTP service
retains its separate 100% default for `RendererTestPercentage`.

Every top-level `.rpl` file is considered, regardless of filename structure.
Physics uses the full corpus. For target `1`, renderer selection first
filters for a nonzero opponent type in the replay header. Renderer sampling
then uses the eligible, ordinal-sorted list before shard balancing; the
percentage applies to that list. For target `0`, all replays remain eligible.
The CI planning job reads recorded tick counts from replay headers and
balances physics and renderer shards separately, targeting totals
within ±2% of each phase's average. It publishes one plan per selected target
as `target0.json` or `target1.json` in the `replay-shard-plan` artifact. The
physics assignments are identical in both plans; renderer assignments use
each target's eligible sample. Replay jobs, oracle extraction, and coverage
checks consume the matching plan and validate its target; the C# application
selects its lists by shard ID. The planner's `--target` option and the C#
application's `Target` setting still select one target per invocation.
A corpus with no opponents has empty renderer shards for target `1`, while
physics still covers every replay.
Workers within a shard still receive round-robin lists whose replay counts
differ by at most one. Sampling is independent of shard and worker counts.
CI validates completed replay identities from the JSON shard results, so missing
or duplicate coverage, processing errors, and byte mismatches fail validation.

The reusable workflow defaults to 20 shards with 5 workers each, 120 seconds
per physics execution, and 980 seconds per renderer execution. It checks C/H
formatting, host regressions, and C# tests and formatting before the selected
builds. When enabled, the DOS build uses native Open Watcom 2 and checks the
DOS platform ABI, dump timer masking, and failure cleanup. Run the C# checks
locally with the .NET 10 SDK:

```sh
python3 tools/scripts/test-plan-replay-shards.py
dotnet test tools/scripts/dumpsrv/dumpsrv.slnx --configuration Release
dotnet format tools/scripts/dumpsrv/dumpsrv.slnx --verify-no-changes
```

### Compiler migration validation

For a deterministic comparison of 100 evenly spaced golden replays in both
physics and rendering, build `repldump`, `pixldump`, and `pixldump-original`, then run:

```sh
python3 tools/scripts/validate-toolchain.py --output out/watcom-validation
```

Use a new output directory. This verifies the archived Borland checksums,
uses the archived physics oracle and freshly built incremental renderer reference,
records SHA-256 fingerprints of executables and inputs, and generates fresh
outputs in an isolated DOS directory. The shared C# runner checks complete
per-frame physics data and camera-2/player framebuffer hashes byte for byte.
See [the oracle guide](tools/oracles/borland/README.md) for coverage, timeout,
and cache options. Run the platform ABI check separately:

```sh
make -C src/restunts test-dos-platform
python3 tools/scripts/run-dos-platform-test.py
```

Check the conventional-memory budget with a complete race, including the
player dashboard and both 320x200 VGA render pages:

```bash
make -C src/restunts test-race-memory
python3 tools/scripts/run-race-memory-test.py --dosbox dosbox
python3 tools/scripts/run-race-memory-test.py --dosbox dosbox-x
```

This regression loads DIA3 for the player and CSIL for the opponent on
`DEFAULT.TRK`, draws with SuperSight off, on, then off again, and reports the
remaining conventional memory. It checks page isolation and presentation, changes
gears and gauges, and reloads the race to check drawing and resource release.
It also requires that the conventional-memory race framebuffer is absent. Run it
in both DOSBox and DOSBox-X; the latter has a smaller conventional-memory budget. The bundled game
and custom car resources are copied to an isolated directory. The test links
all normal game objects; its small test entry makes its memory budget slightly
stricter than the game.
